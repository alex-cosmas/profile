Passionate about cars, road trips, adventures, nature, music, art, and the joy of discovering something new.

# Why I Do What I Do

I’m passionate about crafting digital experiences that solve meaningful problems. My work is driven by a belief that technology, when designed with empathy, has the power to transform how we live, learn, and work. I thrive in roles where collaboration, innovation, and user feedback shape the process—ensuring that every product delivers both value and delight.

**A Unique Blend of Skills:**  
 My journey has given me a rare combination of design, engineering, and strategic product management expertise. I don’t just create; I align vision with execution, ensuring every product is as functional as it is innovative.

**User-Centric Innovation:**  
 I excel at simplifying complexity—turning intricate challenges into user-friendly solutions that meet business goals.

**Hands-On Resourcefulness:**  
 Whether it’s research, workflows, prototyping, or managing a team, I thrive on diving into the details to make things happen.

**Strategic Leadership:**  
 I see the big picture and work backward to build products that not only solve today’s problems but anticipate tomorrow’s needs.

# My Journey

I started my career at the intersection of creativity and technology, building my foundation as a Web Developer. Immersing myself in code and design, I quickly transitioned into Frontend Development, where my curiosity about how users interact with products led me to explore UX and Product Design.

It was during this phase that I discovered my passion: turning complex challenges into elegant, user-centered solutions. This curiosity evolved into a commitment to Product Development and Management, where I now thrive—solving enterprise problems in B2B startups across industries like EdTech, Logistics, and Corporate Governance & Compliance.

Today, as the **Product Lead at Simple Formations**, I guide cross-functional teams to create meaningful digital experiences that drive impact. Based in Nairobi, Kenya, I bring a global perspective to local problems, connecting diverse ideas to create products that truly matter.
