At heart, I'm a Nairobi-based product designer who thrives where technology meets human needs. By day, I transform complex B2B systems into intuitive digital experiences. By life, I'm a family man, adventurer, and eternal curious mind—fueled by road trips, music, and the thrill of discovery.

# Why I Do What I Do

I believe technology's true power lies in its ability to solve real problems with empathy. My mission: to craft products that don't just function beautifully, but meaningfully improve how people work and live.


# How I Got Here

### My Journey

Started in the trenches with VueJS and late-night code. Discovered my real passion wasn't just building—but bridging:  

- **Between engineers** who think in components  
- **Businesses** that need scalable solutions  
- **Users** who just want things to work  

Today, I thrive in that intersection. At Simple Formations, I turn compliance headaches into intuitive flows. On the side, I'm exploring how AI can make enterprise tools feel human.  

*Always grounded in one truth:* **Good design happens when all sides feel heard.**
